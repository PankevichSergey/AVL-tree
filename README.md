# AVL-tree
AVL tree with effectively implemented iterators and such functions as insert, erase, find and lower_bound.

All operations work in non-amortized and guaranteed time. Complexity of operations insert, erase, find, lower_bound and getting or incrementing and iterator is O(log n), where n is a number of elements in the tree.
